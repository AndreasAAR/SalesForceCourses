# Table of Contents

# Profiles<a name="Profiles"></a>

<strong>Profiles manage access to:</strong>
* Fields
* Object types
* Apps

You can also edit properties and add a description to the profile.
Assigned users give you a list of all the users with the profile assigned.
As you get into the meat of the profile, with various settings, with assigned apps etc.
The tabs will have different layouts too depending on your profiles accessible apps or fields.

![sysadScreen](/resources/assignedapp.png)

Here we can see that weve added the app "sales" as the sales dropdown becomes available.

As system administrator built in you will manage call centers and cases.

You can set the profileLogin as well.
<img src = /resources/profileLogin.png>
This gives you the ability to set shorter time windows. If the access is generated from another source you would just the SAMLJithandler interface to manage the login via SSO for example.
<img src = /resources/password.png>
Password policies set how frequently a password expires.

# Roles<a name="Roles"></a>

<img src = roles.png>
Roles means superiors in a hierarchy have access to all the records the lower in the hiearchy have access to.
Roles are seeing others opportunities, if they are related to you in the hierarchy. It does depend on sharing settings however.

<img src = /resources/hiearchyexpanded.png>

If you expand, the role hiearchy will show you all levels and connections in a tree structure.

<img src = UI.png>
You can steer your view style in the UI section.

A record owner can always edit and view its record.

<img src = /resources/sharing.png>

Sharing rules are how you give access to records.
Usually you start exclusively from private, salesforce policy is to <em>start from the lowest possible access/highest safety level</em>.

Permission sets
-------
<details>
  <summary>Click to expand!</summary>
<img src = /resources/permissionset.png>
Permission sets are a bit like extended profiles.
If you have 100s of profiles that likely means you didnt have access to permission sets.
Permission sets are like additional profiles you can have unlimited amounts of.

<p><Strong>When to use permission sets</Strong>  </br>  
 If you only have a few users in a few profiles, and youd want these 3 different people to own the same group? You could extend all of these, but then theyd need to share rights they shouldnt share.
Permission sets is a additional set of granularity.</p>

<img src = /resources/permissiondefault.png>
Per default nothing is checked in SF permission sets.
To just make a chatter permission set we would only need create and use chatter. Thats it.
If we have different user licenses, its important to note that you yourself can only have two salesforce licenses.
Permission sets prevents the creation of hundreds of granular profiles.

<img src = /resources/permissionapps.png>
You can give access to apps via permission sets.
By default you also dont have access to any extra objects by a permission set.
However you wont <span style="color:red"> lose any access</span> by being given <em>permission set</em>.
</details>

Libraries
-----
<details>
  <summary>Click to expand!</summary>
<img src = /resources/libs.png>
Salesforce stores files in searchable folder directories called <em>libraries</em>.
With the search capability you can also search dynamically. You grant users access via library permissions.
Under the shared content tag we can see we dont have access to libraries yet under "my libraries".
You use a library wizard to add.

<img src = /resources/savelib.png>
You can save material to a specific lib, not only pull things from sf into your lib.
By subscribing to a content pack you can get notifications on material added by colleagues etc.
</details>

Groups and Teams
-----
<details>
  <summary>Click to expand!</summary>
Groups and teams are similiar to permission sets.
<img src = /resources/group.png>
We can add both roles and specific users.

  ![Sharing rule](//resources/sharingRule.png)

  Adding people to a team would generally be a way to add someone to a team were they would get access to a bunch of records regardless of earlier access rules.
</details>

Objects and custom objects
-----
<details>



  <summary>Click to expand!</summary>
Objects and their relations can go very deep. THe fields themselves can link to other objects. You have standard and custom fields as well.
Customs <em>API names</em> are always suffixed with <Strong>"__c"</Strong>.


<Strong>Standard Fields</Strong>
Every object has a name field regardless.
The API name and the label name can be different however.
A record can also be owned by different objects. It can be owned by a lookup or a queue.
You can also create custom fields and relationships.
<em>Auto number</em> is system generated, and incremented for each record, for different reasons.
Theres also another formula tool for pulling in values from other objects etc.
<img src = /resources/relationship.png>
<em>Lookup fields</em> are a way to create connections or relationships between objects.
The relationships are two types, children, and parents. You can have many children, but only one parent.
<img src = /resources/relationshipaccess.png>
There are settings for the relationships, to allow for equal or less access to the related object.
